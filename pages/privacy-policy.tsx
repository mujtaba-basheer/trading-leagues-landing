              6.1 To improve the responsiveness of the sites for Our Users, We
              may use “cookies”, or similar electronic tools to collect
              information to assign each visitor a unique, random number as a
              User Identification (User ID) to understand the User’s individual
              interests using the Identified Computer. Unless You voluntarily
              identify yourself (through registration, for exaTradingLeaguese),
              We will have no way of knowing who You are, even if We assign a
              cookie to Your computer. The only personal information a cookie
              can contain is information You supply. A cookie cannot read data
              off Your hard drive. Our advertisers may also assign their own
              cookies to Your browser (if You click on their ads), a process
              that We do not control.
